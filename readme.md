Prototype
=========

Prototype is a collection of prototype(s) and tests so i can check out the new html5 functionality that is introduced by [whatwg](http://www.whatwg.org/) and the great guys at google who implement it.

Please take a look at my [tests and prototype(s) page](http://mientjan.github.com/Prototype)
